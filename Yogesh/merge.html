            <h1>MERGE SORT</h1>
            <p>Merge Sort is a highly efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that systematically breaks down an array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together into a single, sorted array. By recursively dividing the array until each subarray contains only one element, Merge Sort leverages the inherent order of these single elements to merge them back in sorted order. With a guaranteed time complexity of O(n log n), it performs exceptionally well even with large datasets. Its stability and ability to handle large arrays make Merge Sort a robust choice for applications where performance and reliability are critical, such as in databases and large-scale data processing.
