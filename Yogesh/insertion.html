            <h1>INSERTION SORT</h1>
            <p>Insertion Sort is a straightforward and efficient sorting algorithm that builds a sorted sequence one element at a time. It works by dividing the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. The algorithm iteratively takes each element from the unsorted region and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted region, much like how one might sort playing cards in their hands. This process involves comparing the key element with its predecessors, shifting larger elements to the right, and placing the key in its rightful spot. With a best-case time complexity of O(n) for nearly sorted data, Insertion Sort excels in simplicity, stability, and adaptability for small datasets, making it a favored choice for many practical applications.
